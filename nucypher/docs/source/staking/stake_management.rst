Re-staking
~~~~~~~~~~~

As your Ursula performs work, all rewards are automatically added to your existing stake to optimize earnings.
This feature, called `re-staking`, is **enabled** by default.

To disable re-staking:

.. code:: bash

    (nucypher)$ nucypher stake restake --disable

To enable re-staking again:

.. code:: bash

    (nucypher)$ nucypher stake restake --enable


.. _staking-prolong:

Prolong
~~~~~~~

Existing stakes can be extended by a number of periods as long as the resulting
stake's duration is not shorter than the minimum. To prolong an existing stake's duration:

.. code:: bash

    (nucypher)$ nucypher stake prolong --hw-wallet


Wind Down
~~~~~~~~~

The proportion of staking rewards received by a staker depends on the
stake size and the remaining locked duration.

When wind down is enabled, the locked duration decreases after each period which results
in reduced staking yield. When disabled, the stake's locked duration remains
constant and improves staking yield.
See :ref:`sub-stake-winddown` for more information.

Wind down is **disabled** by default.

.. note:: WorkLock participants have wind down **enabled** by default.

To start winding down an existing stake:

.. code:: bash

    (nucypher)$ nucypher stake winddown --enable


To stop winding down:

.. code:: bash

    (nucypher)$ nucypher stake winddown --disable


Snapshots
~~~~~~~~~

Taking snapshots is *enabled* by default. Snapshots must be enabled to participate in the DAO, but it has a slight cost in gas every time your staking balance changes. To stop taking snapshots:

.. code:: bash

    (nucypher)$ nucypher stake snapshots --disable

To enable snapshots again:

.. code:: bash

    (nucypher)$ nucypher stake snapshots --enable



Divide
~~~~~~

Existing stakes can be divided into smaller :ref:`sub-stakes <sub-stakes>`, with different values and durations. Dividing a stake
allows stakers to accommodate different liquidity needs since sub-stakes can have different durations. Therefore, a
staker can liquidate a portion of their overall stake at an earlier time.

To divide an existing stake:

.. code:: bash

    (nucypher)$ nucypher stake divide --hw-wallet

    Select Stake: 0
    Enter target value (15000 NU - 16437.841006996376688377 NU): 15000
    Enter number of periods to extend: 20

Increase
~~~~~~~~

Existing stakes can be increased by an amount of NU as long as the resulting
staker's locked value is not greater than the maximum. To increase an existing stake's value:

.. code:: bash

    (nucypher)$ nucypher stake increase --hw-wallet


Merge
~~~~~

Two stakes with the same final period can be merged into one stake.
This can help to decrease gas consumption in some operations. To merge two stakes:

.. code:: bash

    (nucypher)$ nucypher stake merge --hw-wallet


Remove unused sub-stake
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When sub-stakes terminate, are merged or edited,
there may be 'unused', inactive sub-stakes remaining on-chain.
Continued tracking of these unused sub-stakes adds unnecessary gas costs to daily operations.
Consequently, removal of unused sub-stakes will reduce daily gas costs.

Unused sub-stakes can be displayed by listing all sub-stakes
and will be indicated by the ``INACTIVE`` status label.

.. code:: bash

    (nucypher)$ nucypher stake list --all --hw-wallet

    ...

    ╒═══════╤═══════════════╤═════════════╤═════════════╤═══════════════╤═══════════╕
    │   Idx │ Value         │   Remaining │ Enactment   │ Termination   │ Status    │

To remove an unused sub-stake, run the following command and select the index
of your ``INACTIVE`` sub-stake:

.. code:: bash

    (nucypher)$ nucypher stake remove-unused --hw-wallet


In order to make the operation as simple and cheap as possible,
the removal algorithm simply relocates the last active sub-stake to the slot
occupied by the currently inactive one, so you will notice a slight
re-ordering of your sub-stakes. This is normal and doesn't have any negative implications.


Collect Staker Rewards
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

NuCypher nodes earn two types of rewards: staking rewards (in NU) and policy fees (i.e., service fees in ETH).
To collect these rewards use ``nucypher stake collect-reward`` with flags ``--staking-reward`` and ``--policy-fee``
(or even both).

While staking rewards can only be collected to the original staker account, you can decide which account receives
policy fees using the ``--withdraw-address <ETH_ADDRESS>`` flag.

.. code:: bash

    (nucypher)$ nucypher stake collect-reward --staking-reward --policy-fee --staking-address 0x270b3f8af5ba2B79ea3Bd6a6Efc7ecAB056d3E3f --hw-wallet

You can run ``nucypher stake accounts`` to verify that your staking compensation
is indeed in your wallet. Use your favorite Ethereum wallet (MyCrypto or Metamask
are suitable) to transfer out the compensation earned (NU tokens or ETH) after
that.

Note that you will need to confirm two transactions if you collect both types of
staking compensation if you use a hardware wallet.

.. note:: If you want to withdraw all tokens when all of them are unlocked -
          make sure to call ``nucypher stake mint`` first to ensure the last reward is included


View Staker Blockchain Events
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As the Staker and its associated Worker interact with the StakingEscrow smart contract, various on-chain events
are emitted. These events are outlined :doc:`here </contracts_api/main/StakingEscrow>`, and are made accessible via the
``nucypher stake events`` CLI command.

For simple Staker accounting, events such as ``CommitmentMade``, ``Withdrawn``, and ``Minted`` can
be used. The output of each can be correlated using the period number.

For example, to view all of the staking rewards received by a specific Staker thus far, run:

.. code::

    $ nucypher stake events --staking-address <STAKER ADDRESS> --provider <PROVIDER URI> --event-name Minted

    --------- StakingEscrow Events ---------

    Minted:
      - (EventRecord) staker: <STAKER ADDRESS>, period: 18551, value: 1234567890123456789012, block_number: 11070103
      - (EventRecord) staker: <STAKER ADDRESS>, period: 18552, value: 1234567890123456789012, block_number: 11076964
      ...

``1234567890123456789012`` is in NuNits and equates to approximately 1234.57 NU (1 NU = 10\ :sup:`18` NuNits).

To aid with management of this information, instead of outputting the information to the CLI, the event data can
be written to a CSV file using either of the following command-line options:

* ``--csv`` - flag to write event information to a CSV file with a default filename in the current directory
* ``--csv-file <FILEPATH>`` - write event information to a CSV file at the provided filepath

For example,

.. code::

    $ nucypher stake events --staking-address <STAKER ADDRESS> --provider <PROVIDER URI> --event-name Minted --csv

    StakingEscrow::Minted events written to ./Minted_2021-02-09_15-23-25.csv

.. code::

    $ nucypher stake events --staking-address <STAKER ADDRESS> --provider <PROVIDER URI> --event-name Minted --csv-file ~/Minted_Events.csv

    StakingEscrow::Minted events written to /<HOME DIRECTORY>/Minted_Events.csv
